## Introduction

The binding engine is an utility export of `aurelia-binding` module, which gives some higher level APIs for dealing with observation, which leverages aurelia binding system primitives under the hood.

## How to install

Retrieving an instance of the `BindingEngine` by injecting it to any of your class inside an Aurelia application:

```js
import { BindingEngine } from 'aurelia-framework'; // or 'aurelia-binding'

export class MyViewModel {

  static inject() {
    return [BindingEngine]
  }

  constructor(bindingEngine) {
    //
  }
}
```

> Note: you can also construct the `BindingEngine` instance directly, or get it from a container. The example goes with simplest code.

Now let's use it to observe changes on objects (arrays are objects too). Generally, we will use `propertyObserver(obj, propertyName)` for object property value changes and `collectionObserver(collection)` for collection mutation.

## Observing a property on an object

* `propertyObserver(obj, propertyName)` returns a `PropertyObserver` object, with a public method `subscribe` that can be used like the following example:

```js
  bindingEngine
    .propertyObserver(myObject, 'myObjectPropertyName')
    .subscribe((newValue, oldValue) => {
      // handle value change here
    });
```

## Observing a collection mutation

* `collectionObserver(collection)` returns a `CollectionObserver` object, with a public method `subscribe` that can be used like the following example:

```js
  bindingEngine
    .collectionObserver(myCollection)
    .subscribe((splice) => {
      // do something with the mutated collection
    })
```

`splice` is an object with `ICollectionObserverSplice` interface, source code [here](https://github.com/aurelia/binding/blob/b42630b9ef94f84f39e450d959ddaa721d82e5d5/src/aurelia-binding.d.ts#L148)

## Observing an expression on an object

Often times you would want to observe a chain of property accesses (or a path), binding engine also has an API to support this. You can use `expressionObserver(obj, expressionString)` to create an observer, that will notify you when any property within the path of `expressionString` has been changed, like the following example:

```js
  bindingEngine
    .expressionObserver(this, 'project.name')
    .subscribe((newProjectName, oldProjectName) => {
      // do something with the new project name value
    });
```
